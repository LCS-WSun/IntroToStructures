# About Abstractions
 
 So, what is an *abstraction*?

 * It's when we hide implementation details to make something more general
 * Why do this?
    * to make something easier to use
    * all you need to know, then, is how to use the abstraction
    * you no longer need to know about the details
 
 At it's core, a computer understands only *high voltage* (1's) and *low voltage* (0's).
 
 The base 2 number system, or binary, allows us to encode meaning from combining 1's and 0's.
 
 For example, the binary sequence `00001110` represents the number 14 in base 10, or decimal.
 
 By general agreement among computer manufacturers many decades ago, [certain numbers have been assigned to represent certain letters of the Latin alphabet](http://www.asciitable.com).
 
 ASCII is an outdated standard, and worldwide, there are many different languages and alphabets in use.
 
 [Unicode is the current standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters) for how computers represent, or *abstract* away, how letterforms and glyphs are shown on screen.
