# About Functions
 
 Functions are another way to use abstraction.
 
 For example, a few classes ago, we looked at how to write a function to calculate the length of a line segment.

 Here was our [definition of that function](https://ln2.sync.com/dl/91fb53920/jnvp6vqv-mkjg8p5p-q4jifd4a-8ieji2in/view/image/10167346380008). That is how we "teach" the computer to do the new "trick" of finding the length of a line segment.
 
 Here was how we [invoked that function](https://ln2.sync.com/dl/5a2bd57d0/cvemjdsx-69ibbqjb-giernfkw-fzn9czbx/view/image/10167346410008). This is how we tell the computer to *use* the function and calculate an output (an answer for us) based on the inputs we provide.
 
 Where does *abstraction* come in? Once the function is defined, and tested to be sure it is providing correct output, we never need to think about how it works again. We can just invoke it – use it – as needed.
