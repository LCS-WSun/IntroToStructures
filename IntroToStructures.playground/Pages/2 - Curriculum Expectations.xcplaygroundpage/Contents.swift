# Curriculum Expectations
 
 Before diving in further – by reading and completing the activities in this document, you will be developing *better* evidence for the following expectations:
 
 ## Application
 
 **A1.1:** Use constants and variables, including integers, floating points, strings, and Boolean values, correctly in computer programs.
 
 **A1.4:** demonstrate the ability to use... arithmetic operators (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, parentheses), and order of operations correctly in computer programs;
 
 **A3.2:** write subprograms (e.g., functions, procedures) that use parameter passing and appropriate variable scope (e.g., local, global), to perform tasks within programs.

 ## Communication
 
 **A4.2:** Use workplace and professional conventions (e.g., naming, indenting, commenting) correctly to write programs and internal documentation;
 
 **A4.5:** Demonstrate the ability to validate a program using a full range of test cases.
 
 ## Thinking
 
 **B2.3:** Apply the principle of modularity to design reusable code (e.g., subprograms, classes) in computer programs;
 
 **B3.2:** solve common problems (e.g., calculation of hypotenuse, determination of primes, calculation of area and circumference) by applying mathematical equations or formulas in an algorithm;
 
 Be sure to document what you complete in your portfolio for this thread.
